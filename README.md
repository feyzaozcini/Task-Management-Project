## Task Management Project
In this project,
- In the user service, users are registered and logged in.
- In the project service, projects are recorded in the system. Afterwards, projects used more than once are cached to the Redis side when a Get request is made.
- In the task service, a new task is created using users and the project.-
- There are 4 microservices, when a task created via task-service that service insert a record onto task table(postgre) and it produce an event to task_service.task_created.0 topic.And when a task updated via task-service that service update a record onto task table(postgre) and it produce an event to task_service.task_updated.0 topic.
- Notification-consumer service listen task_service.task_created.0 and task_service.task_updated.0 topics and simulates the logic of sending notification after the event it consumes after notification is sending successfully service insert a record onto couchbase notification bucket.

## Setup
- Before run project you need to start docker desktop
- After docker is up, run the docker-compose.yml 
- After the run docker-compose.yml file you will see docker desktop like this:

## DB Connection
# Postgre Connection:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/userservice
    username: prostgres
    password: test

    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/projectservice
    username: prostgres
    password: test

    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/taskservice
    username: prostgres
    password: test


# Couchbase Connection & Settings
- #### Open http://localhost:8091/ on your browser

![](images/login.JPG)

      username: Administrator
      password: 123456

- #### Open the buckets tab and click the **ADD BUCKET**
![](images/add_bucket.png)

- #### write the bucket name in our example => bucket name is **"notification"**
![](images/add_bucket_to_cluster.png)

- #### After that open the query tab on the left side
![](images/QUERY.JPG)
- #### Run 2 query separately to create index on bucket

      1) CREATE PRIMARY INDEX `idx_default_primary_notification` ON `notification`
      2) CREATE INDEX `id` ON `notification`(`id`)
- #### Open the Security tab on the left side and click the **ADD USER** 
![](images/add_user.png)
- #### After click the add user you will see a new popup and fill the informations like :
      Username: admin
      Full Name: admin
      Password: 123456
      Verify Password: 123456

POST	| /auth/login	| Login for users	|
GET	| /auth/{id}	| Get specific user information by id	| 
GET	| /auth/ids	| Get multiple user information	| 

## Project Service
Projects and information are recorded in the system

GET	| /projects	| Get all the projects	
GET	| /projects/{id} |Get specific project by id	  
POST	| /projects	| Create new project	
POST	| /projects/search	|Searching for projects with specific features
PUT	| /projects	| Update project	
DELETE	| /projects/{id}	| Delete project by id	

### Project Cache Redis

- Caching multiple projects and then calling them from there is good for the performance of the project.

## Task Service
Task creation service using user and project service

Method	| Path	| Description	
------------- | ------------------------- | ------------- |
GET	| /tasks	| Get all the tasks
GET	| /tasks/{id}	| Get specific task by id	
POST	| /tasks	| Create new task
POST	| /tasks/search	| Searching for tasks with specific features
PUT	| /tasks	| Update task

## Notification Service
The Notification Service listens for task creation and update events using Kafka. It produces notifications for these events and records them in Couchbase.

### Kafka Topics:
taskservice.task_created.0: Published when a task is created.

taskservice.task_updated.0: Published when a task is updated.
