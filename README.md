## Task Management Project
In this project,
- In the user service, users are registered and logged in.
- In the project service, projects are recorded in the system. Afterwards, projects used more than once are cached to the Redis side when a Get request is made.
- In the task service, a new task is created using users and the project.-
- There are 4 microservices, when a task created via task-service that service insert a record onto task table(postgre) and it produce an event to task_service.task_created.0 topic.And when a task updated via task-service that service update a record onto task table(postgre) and it produce an event to task_service.task_updated.0 topic.
- Notification-consumer service listen task_service.task_created.0 and task_service.task_updated.0 topics and simulates the logic of sending notification after the event it consumes after notification is sending successfully service insert a record onto couchbase notification bucket.
